# TODO:
- Develop a symbolic expression for sigma(::ScatteringLine, phi)
    - Function of phi, lambda, and line length
    - Maybe simplify to function of angle and line length (in lamdba's)
    - Fallback: estimate using JefimenkoModels and basis functions
- Implement a planform generator that automatically collects edge sources, surface sources (with a given density & severity)
